# Build a Responsive Website in a Week

A responsive design tutorial in 5 parts, originally written for <http://netmagazine.com/>. Itâ€™s hosted here so you can track changes, clone it for your own needs and hopefully contribute improvements.

1. [Designing Responsively](1-designing-responsively/content.md)
2. [Responsive Typography and Grids](2-typography-and-grids/content.md)
3. [Responsive Images and Video](3-images-and-video/content.md)
4. [Getting to Grips With Media Queries](4-media-queries/content.md)
5. [Going further with Responsive Web Design](5-going-further/content.md)

_While this tutorial still serves as a useful introduction to responsive web design, as it was written in 2012 and has not been updated since, some of the recommendations may have become outdated._

## Example site

The finished example website, which was originally available at <http://roadtrip.paulrobertlloyd.com/> is now served from the `gh-pages` branch of this repo, and available to view at <http://paulrobertlloyd.github.io/roadtrip>. This example site (and related tutorial files) originally used Proxima Nova, but since my font license has expired, fallback fonts will be seen instead.
